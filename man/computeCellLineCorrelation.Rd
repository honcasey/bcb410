\title{Compute correlations between drug sensitivity measures of cell lines}
\usage{
computeCellLineCorrelation(pSet, coefs, sensMeasures, pval = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pSet}{Intersected PharmacoSet object containing common drugs and/or
cell lines, as returned by PharmacoGx::intersectPSet(). PharmacoSets
should have sensitivity information which can be checked using
PharmacoGx::availablePSets() in the 'type' column.}

\item{coefs}{List of correlation coefficients of interest. Current options
are: "pearson", "spearman", "kendall".}

\item{sensMeasures}{List of drug sensitivity measures of interest. Options
depend on the PharmacoSets chosen, and can be identified by looking at
names(pSetName@sensitivity[["profiles"]])}

\item{pval}{Logical of whether or not to include p-values of each
correlation coefficient. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of dataframes, one dataframe for each sensitivity
    measure of interest, where rows correspond to cell lines and columns
    correspond to each type of correlation coefficient from coefs.
    Also includes p-values in columns is pval was set to TRUE.
}
\description{
Computes Pearson, Spearman, and/or Kendall Correlation Coefficients and
    associated p-values for specified drug sensitivity measures
    (such as IC50 of AUC) between common cell lines of two or more
    PharmacoSets.
